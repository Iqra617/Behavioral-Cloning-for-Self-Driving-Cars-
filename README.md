# Behavioral Cloning for Self-Driving Cars
A supervised regression problem between the car steering angles and the road images in front of a car.

The project is based on the research by Nvidia.The network is a CNN which maps raw pixel inputs along with steering data from a log file and clones the behaviour of the steering in autonomous mode.
